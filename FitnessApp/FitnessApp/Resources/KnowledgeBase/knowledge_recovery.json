    "content": "**HRV Fundamentals**\n\nHeart Rate Variability measures beat-to-beat variation in heart rhythm, reflecting autonomic nervous system balance. Higher HRV generally indicates parasympathetic dominance (rest and digest), while lower HRV indicates sympathetic dominance (fight or flight).\n\n**Measurement Protocol**\n\n*Standardization is Critical:*\n- Same time daily (within 30-minute window)\n- Same position (supine recommended, or seated if always seated)\n- Same duration (minimum 2-3 minutes, ideally 5 minutes)\n- Before caffeine, significant movement, or stress\n- Morning upon waking is gold standard\n- Empty bladder (full bladder affects readings)\n\n*Devices:*\n- Chest strap (Polar H10, Garmin HRM-Pro): Most accurate\n- Wrist devices: Acceptable for trends, less accurate day-to-day\n- Ring devices (Oura, etc.): Good for overnight average\n- Apps: HRV4Training, Elite HRV, Oura—each has slightly different algorithms\n\n**Interpreting HRV Data**\n\n*Baseline Establishment:*\n- Minimum 2 weeks of consistent measurement to establish personal baseline\n- 7-day rolling average is more meaningful than single readings\n- Individual variation is huge (RMSSD 20-150+ ms all 'normal')\n- Compare to YOUR baseline, not population norms\n\n*Key Metrics:*\n- RMSSD: Most commonly used, reflects parasympathetic activity\n- HRV4Training's rMSSD: Normalized, comparable across apps\n- Oura's HRV: Overnight average, different interpretation\n- LF/HF ratio: Less reliable than RMSSD for training decisions\n\n**Decision Protocols Based on HRV**\n\n*Daily HRV vs 7-Day Baseline:*\n\nHRV within normal range (±0.5 SD or within ~10%):\n- Train as planned\n- Body responding normally to training\n\nHRV moderately below baseline (10-20% below, or 0.5-1.0 SD):\n- Consider reducing planned intensity\n- Swap intervals for tempo or tempo for easy\n- If intervals planned, reduce volume or add extra recovery\n- Ask: 'How do I feel?' If also feeling tired, definitely back off\n\nHRV significantly below baseline (>20% below, or >1.0 SD):\n- Strong signal for recovery day\n- Convert planned workout to easy or rest\n- Check for other factors: poor sleep, illness onset, high stress\n- If persists 2-3 days: Consider recovery block\n\nHRV above baseline (>1.0 SD above normal):\n- Usually positive: well recovered, adaptation occurring\n- Occasionally: Parasympathetic saturation (after very hard block)\n- Green light for quality training\n\n*Pattern Recognition:*\n\nGradually declining HRV trend over 1-2 weeks:\n- Accumulated fatigue\n- May need recovery week sooner than planned\n- Review recent training load (ACWR)\n\nSudden HRV spike (unusually high):\n- Often precedes illness by 24-48 hours\n- Monitor for other symptoms\n- Consider preventive rest day\n\nLow HRV with elevated resting HR:\n- Strong overtraining signal\n- Possible illness onset\n- Prioritize sleep, nutrition, stress reduction\n\n**HRV-Guided Training Modifications**\n\n*Example Decision Tree:*\n\nPlanned: Threshold intervals (2×20 min)\nHRV: 15% below baseline\nResting HR: Normal\nSubjective feel: 'Legs heavy but okay'\n\nDecision: Modify to sweet spot (2×20 min at 88-90% FTP instead of 95-100%)\nRationale: Get quality work without digging deeper into recovery debt\n\n*Example Decision Tree:*\n\nPlanned: Long run (18 miles)\nHRV: 25% below baseline\nResting HR: Elevated 5 bpm\nSubjective: 'Tired, didn't sleep well'\n\nDecision: Easy 45-minute run or complete rest\nRationale: Multiple signals pointing to need for recovery\n\n**Limitations of HRV**\n\n- Not predictive of performance on any single day\n- Individual response varies significantly\n- Some athletes are 'non-responders' to HRV tracking\n- Affected by: alcohol, travel, stress, caffeine, supplements\n- Should not override race-day decisions\n- One data point among many; combine with subjective feel, resting HR, sleep quality",

    "content": "**Understanding Supercompensation**\n\n*The Stress-Adaptation Cycle:*\n1. Training stimulus (stress)\n2. Fatigue and temporary performance decrease\n3. Recovery period\n4. Supercompensation (fitness above baseline)\n5. Detraining (if no new stimulus) or new stimulus (continued adaptation)\n\n*Critical Timing:*\n- Next workout too soon: Inadequate recovery, cumulative fatigue\n- Next workout at right time: Build on supercompensation, progressive overload\n- Next workout too late: Supercompensation fades, opportunity missed\n\n*Practical Application:*\n- Time between hard sessions varies by individual and workout type\n- General guideline: 48-72 hours between hard sessions\n- May need more as athlete ages or during high life stress\n\n**Recovery Timelines by Session Type**\n\n*Very Easy Session (Zone 1, short):*\n- Recovery time: 12-24 hours\n- Can train hard the next day\n- Example: 30-min recovery spin, easy swim\n\n*Moderate Aerobic (Zone 2, long):*\n- Recovery time: 24-36 hours\n- Example: 90-min endurance ride, long easy run\n- May need easy day following, can train hard in 2 days\n\n*Tempo/Sweet Spot Session:*\n- Recovery time: 36-48 hours\n- Example: 2×20min sweet spot, tempo run\n- Easy day following recommended\n\n*Threshold Session:*\n- Recovery time: 48-72 hours\n- Example: 2×20min at FTP, threshold intervals\n- Should not do another hard session for 2 days minimum\n\n*VO2max Session:*\n- Recovery time: 48-72 hours\n- High neuromuscular and cardiovascular demand\n- Example: 5×4min at 105-115% FTP\n- Quality suffers if done too frequently\n\n*Race or Race-Simulation:*\n- Recovery time: 72-96+ hours depending on duration and intensity\n- Full recovery may take 1-2 weeks for major race\n- Avoid quality training for several days after\n\n*Long Endurance Session (3+ hours):*\n- Recovery time: 48-72 hours\n- Glycogen depletion, significant muscle damage\n- Example: Long ride, marathon-pace long run\n- Next day should be rest or very easy\n\n**Microcycle Recovery Patterns**\n\n*Classic Pattern (3:1 loading):*\n- Week 1: 100% planned load\n- Week 2: 105-110% planned load\n- Week 3: 110-115% planned load\n- Week 4: 50-60% (recovery week)\n\n*Aggressive Pattern (2:1 loading):*\n- Weeks 1-2: Progressive loading\n- Week 3: Recovery\n- Best for: Masters athletes, high life stress, injury-prone\n\n*Conservative Pattern (4:1 loading):*\n- Weeks 1-4: Progressive loading\n- Week 5: Recovery\n- Best for: Young athletes, low life stress, high recovery capacity\n\n**Recovery Week Prescription**\n\n*Volume:* 50-65% of normal\n*Intensity:* Remove or drastically reduce hard sessions\n*Structure:*\n\nExample Recovery Week (normally training 10 hrs):\n- Monday: Rest\n- Tuesday: 45 min easy + 4 strides (not intervals)\n- Wednesday: 60 min Zone 2 only\n- Thursday: Rest or 30 min easy\n- Friday: 45 min with 10 min tempo (just a touch)\n- Saturday: 90 min easy (vs normal 3 hr long)\n- Sunday: 45 min easy\n\n*What to Add:*\n- Extra sleep (30-60 min more per night)\n- Mobility and flexibility work\n- Massage or other recovery modalities\n- Social, non-training activities\n- Catch up on life demands\n\n*What to Expect:*\n- Days 1-2: May feel flat, sluggish, 'taper tantrum'\n- Days 3-4: Body realizes it's recovering\n- Days 5-7: Energy returning, motivation building\n- Post-recovery week: Ready for productive training\n\n**Mesocycle Recovery (Training Blocks)**\n\n*After Base Block (12-16 weeks):*\n- Recovery: 1 full recovery week\n- May feel loss of urgency; this is normal\n- Prepare mentally for build phase intensity\n\n*After Build Block (6-8 weeks):*\n- Recovery: 1 week before competition phase\n- Or transition directly into taper for A-race\n\n*After Race/Competition Block:*\n- Short races (5K-half marathon): 3-7 days recovery\n- Marathon: 2-3 weeks very easy before structured training\n- Ironman: 3-4 weeks recovery minimum; 6-8 weeks common\n- Stage race/heavy competition block: 1-2 weeks easy\n\n**Deload vs Recovery Week**\n\n*Deload Week:*\n- Reduced volume (60-70%)\n- Maintains some intensity\n- Purpose: Absorb fitness before key workout or test\n- Duration: 3-5 days typically\n\n*Recovery Week:*\n- Significantly reduced volume (50-60%)\n- Minimal or no intensity\n- Purpose: Full systemic recovery, mental break\n- Duration: 5-7 days\n\n*When to Use Each:*\n- Deload: Before FTP test, before key race simulation, mid-block refresh\n- Recovery: End of training block, after A-race, when showing fatigue signs",
