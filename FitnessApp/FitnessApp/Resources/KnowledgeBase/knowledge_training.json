(2003): Kenyan marathon runners, 85% low / 15% high\n- Studies comparing polarized vs threshold training show polarized produces equal or better results with less burnout (Stöggl & Sperlich, 2014)\n\n**Why Polarized Works**\n\n*Low Intensity (Zone 1-2) Adaptations:*\n- Mitochondrial biogenesis\n- Capillary density increase\n- Fat oxidation improvement\n- Aerobic enzyme enhancement\n- Mental recovery while training\n- Sustainable volume accumulation\n\n*High Intensity (Zone 4-5) Adaptations:*\n- VO2max improvement\n- Lactate threshold elevation\n- Neuromuscular power\n- Race-specific fitness\n- Psychological toughness\n\n*Why Avoid the Middle (Zone 3):*\n- Too hard to accumulate volume\n- Too easy to drive high-end adaptations\n- Creates most fatigue per unit of adaptation\n- 'Black hole' training: feels productive but isn't optimal\n\n**Practical Implementation**\n\n*Defining Zones for 80/20:*\n- Low: Below VT1 (ventilatory threshold 1), conversational pace\n  - Can speak in full sentences\n  - Heart rate typically <75-80% max\n  - Power <75% FTP\n- High: Above VT2 (ventilatory threshold 2), hard effort\n  - Cannot speak more than a few words\n  - Heart rate >88-90% max\n  - Power >90% FTP\n\n*Weekly Structure Example (10 hours/week):*\n- 8 hours easy (Zone 1-2)\n- 2 hours hard (Zone 4-5)\n- Minimize Zone 3 'no man's land'\n\n*Common Mistake: Easy Days Too Hard*\n- Most age-groupers run Zone 3 on 'easy' days\n- Monitor heart rate on easy days\n- Should feel genuinely easy, almost too easy\n- Ego check: slow down\n\n**Polarized vs Pyramidal vs Threshold-Based**\n\n*Polarized:*\n- ~80% low, ~15-20% high, ~0-5% moderate\n- Best for: High volume athletes, avoiding burnout\n\n*Pyramidal:*\n- ~75% low, ~15% moderate, ~10% high\n- More Zone 3 work than polarized\n- Best for: Middle-distance events, time-crunched athletes\n\n*Threshold-Focused:*\n- ~65% low, ~25% moderate, ~10% high\n- Heavy sweet spot and tempo work\n- Best for: Time-crunched (<8 hrs/week), responds well to threshold\n\n**Individual Response**\n- Some athletes thrive on more threshold work\n- Monitor: If performance plateaus despite training, try more polarized approach\n- Age-group athletes often benefit from polarized model due to recovery limitations\n\n**Tracking Distribution**\n- Use training software to calculate time-in-zone\n- Review monthly distribution, not just weekly\n- Heart rate zones more practical than power for this analysis\n- Common finding: Athletes think they're 80/20 but are actually 60/30/10",
