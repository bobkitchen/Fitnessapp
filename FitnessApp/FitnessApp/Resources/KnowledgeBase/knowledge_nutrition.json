    "content": "**The Principle of Nutritional Periodization**\n\nJust as training varies across the year, nutrition should adapt to support current training demands and goals. One-size-fits-all approaches leave performance on the table.\n\n**Carbohydrate Periodization**\n\n*Training Phase Carbohydrate Targets (g/kg bodyweight/day):*\n\nOff-Season/Recovery:\n- 3-5 g/kg/day\n- Lower volume = lower fuel needs\n- Focus on nutrient density over quantity\n\nBase/Aerobic Building:\n- 5-7 g/kg/day\n- Supporting increased volume\n- Adequate for Zone 2 adaptations\n\nBuild/Intensity Phase:\n- 6-8 g/kg/day\n- Higher intensity increases carb reliance\n- Quality carbs around key sessions\n\nRace Week/Competition:\n- 8-12 g/kg/day (carb loading)\n- Glycogen supercompensation\n- Detailed protocol below\n\n*Daily Carbohydrate Timing:*\n\nHard Training Day:\n- Pre-workout (2-4 hrs): 1-2 g/kg\n- During workout (if >90 min): 60-90 g/hr\n- Post-workout (within 2 hrs): 1-1.5 g/kg\n- Remaining meals: Distribute rest of daily target\n\nEasy/Recovery Day:\n- Lower total carb intake\n- Distribute evenly across meals\n- Can use for 'train low' adaptations if desired\n\n**Train Low, Compete High Strategy**\n\n*Concept:* Deliberately restrict carbohydrates for some training sessions to enhance fat oxidation and metabolic flexibility, while fully fueling for key sessions and all competitions.\n\n*Methods:*\n\nSleep Low:\n- Evening workout depletes glycogen\n- Low-carb dinner\n- Fasted morning session (Zone 2 only)\n- Breaks fast with carbs post-workout\n\nTrain Low:\n- Selected easy sessions with restricted carbs\n- Never for high-intensity or key sessions\n- Water and electrolytes only during session\n\nTwice-a-Day Training:\n- First session depletes glycogen\n- Low-carb between sessions\n- Second session done in depleted state\n\n*Important Caveats:*\n- Only for experienced athletes\n- Never train low for intensity sessions\n- Immune suppression risk if overdone\n- Quality of high-intensity work suffers without carbs\n- Periodize carefully: 2-3 sessions/week maximum\n- Always compete with full glycogen stores\n\n**Protein Periodization**\n\n*Daily Targets by Phase:*\n\nMaintenance/Off-Season:\n- 1.2-1.4 g/kg/day\n- Basic muscle maintenance\n- Recovery from reduced training\n\nHigh-Volume Training:\n- 1.4-1.6 g/kg/day\n- Supporting muscle repair from volume\n- Spread across 4-5 meals\n\nHigh-Intensity/Build Phase:\n- 1.6-1.8 g/kg/day\n- Higher demands from intensity\n- Extra focus on post-workout protein\n\nWeight Loss Phase:\n- 1.8-2.2 g/kg/day\n- Preserving muscle during deficit\n- Higher protein satiety helps adherence\n\n*Protein Timing:*\n- Post-workout: 20-40g within 2 hours (leucine threshold)\n- Evening/before bed: 30-40g casein or slow protein\n- Spread remaining across meals (3-4 hour intervals)\n- Minimum per meal: 20g (to trigger muscle protein synthesis)\n\n**Fat Considerations**\n\n- Minimum: 20% of calories (hormone health, absorption of fat-soluble vitamins)\n- Typical range: 20-35% of calories\n- Quality matters: Prioritize omega-3s, monounsaturated fats\n- Timing: Lower fat around workouts (slows digestion)\n- Sources: Fatty fish, olive oil, nuts, avocado",
